And those costs could go up the longer such measures drag on.\nIn response to the accelerating pandemic, a growing number of states have banned all nonessential activities and asked residents to stay home. Across the country, colleges and offices have gone entirely online, schools and restaurants are closed and nursing homes are barring visitors. Such social distancing\xa0can stop, or at least slow, the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus (SN: 3/13/20).\nBut \u201cfor some people, a lack of social connectedness feels as impactful as not eating,\u201d says Joshua Morganstein, a psychiatrist and disaster mental health expert at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md.\nResearch on the psychological toll of social distancing during epidemics is limited. But a review in the March 14\xa0Lancet\xa0provides some clues. Researchers evaluated 24 studies looking at the psychological outcomes of people who were quarantined, an extreme form of social distancing, during outbreaks of SARS, H1N1 flu, Ebola and other infectious diseases since the early 2000s.\nMany\xa0quarantined individuals experienced both short- and long-term mental health problems, including stress, insomnia, emotional exhaustion and substance abuse. For instance, one study compared quarantined versus non-quarantined individuals during an equine influenza outbreak. Of 2,760 quarantined people, 34 percent, or 938 individuals, reported high levels of psychological distress, which can indicate mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, during the outbreak compared with 12 percent of non-quarantined individuals.\nAnother study looked at the effects of the 2003 SARS outbreak on 549 hospital workers in Beijing. Those who were quarantined or worked in high-risk settings \u2014 almost half the sample \u2014 reported higher levels of alcohol abuse three years later than workers with less-intense exposure to the outbreak"

They can\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\nThe source added that the analysts would have to acknowledge how helpful Putin has been in a number of sensitive and strategic areas, such as securing Syria\u2019s agreement to surrender its chemical weapons and convincing Iran to accept tight limits on its nuclear program.\n\n\u201cIsrael has nuclear weapons and a crazy leader,\u201d the source said about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cIf not for Putin, the guy may have used it [a nuclear bomb] in Iran. He [Putin] calmed things down in Syria. They [CIA analysts] aren\u2019t that stupid. To tell the truth, you have to say he [Putin] saved the Middle East a lot of trouble"

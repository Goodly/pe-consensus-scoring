Title: FlyDubai Crash In Russia Now Labeled “Criminal Act” After US Missile Fragments Found

A grim Federal Security Service (FSB) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that the investigation into the deadly Flydubai Flight 981 crash this past Saturday (19 March) at Rostov Airport in Rostov-on-Don has now been turned over to The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation (SLEDKOM) as a “special criminal case” after evidence was found this plane was destroyed by two shoulder fired missiles of American origin—and which video surveillance tapes prove this plane was in the process of exploding prior to its landing. 

According to this report, SLEDKOM is the main federal investigating authority in Russia answerable to President Putin—and whose director, Alexander Bastrykin, took the lead in the investigation of this crash over the Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) and Interstate Aviation Committee (IAC) who were initially tasked with it, and due to a number of “shocking discoveries” that were made involving this horrific tragedy that killed 62.

Among the first of these “shocking discoveries” made, this report continues (and we previously report on), was that among the dead from this crash was a “high level” American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) official traveling on a forged British passport using the name Larisa Allen, and that this plane was carrying US$27 million in cash.

As to what caused this plane to explode and leave a debris field of over 1.7 kilometers (1 mile), FSB analysts in this report state, was due to its being struck by two FIM-92 Stinger shoulder fired infrared homing surface-to-air missiles while it was in the process of landing—and which were identified by the unique “chemical signature” of the high-explosive used in them.

Though these missiles are made by the American defense giant Raytheon, this report continues explaining, the high-explosive used in the attack upon FlyDubai Flight 981 has been traced to the Turkish weapons manufacturer and defense contractor Roketsan which manufactures these Stinger shoulder fired missiles under a license granted to them by the European multinational defense giant Airbus Group.

The “combat sophistication” of this missile attack against FlyDubai Flight 981 is, also, to be noted, this report says, due to this plane being “nearly simultaneously” struck in its left wing section (which caused the main jet fuel explosion) and rear galley section where the flight recorders for this type aircraft are situated—and which left these flight recorders so damaged, IAC investigators say it will be over a month to retrieve their data, if at all. 

To the “motivational terror actors” behind this attack, this report continues, it appears to be Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko—both of whom have publically voiced their extreme hatred of Russia, and after their 9 March meeting in Ankara to form their “Black Sea Axis” against the Federation, the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) noted a US$7 million bank transfer from Poroshenko to Erdoğan that was followed by the loading onto Poroshenko’s plane of 5 “heavily shielded” crates whose contents were not able to be determined—but could very well have contained these FIM-92 Stinger missiles made by Roketsan used to destroy FlyDubai Flight 981.

As to why Poroshenko would want to attack Russia in such a vile manner, this report says, was, most likely, his attempt to “change/misdirect” the trial outcome for Ukrainian “spy/terrorist” Nadiya (Nadezhda) Savchenko—but who, in spite of the deliberate downing of FlyDubai Flight 981, earlier today was found guilty of murdering two Russian journalists in 2014.

As we had previously noted about this Ukrainian terrorist murder Savchenko back in January, the FSB had used in the trial to convict her numerous “beyond top secret” emails obtained by Russian intelligence analysts from the unsecured computer of former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

This report concludes by noting that the FSB is, also, investigating other “terror scenarios” for SLEDKOM involving this tragedy, including its link to the Islamic State, Western governments and organized crime elements, all of whom in the past have shown little to no regard for human life.

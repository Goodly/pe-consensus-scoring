While the detection of viable virus means it\u2019s theoretically possible to transmit the disease from contaminated surfaces or from the air\u2014in addition to the typical route of having larger droplets land directly on a new host after an infected person, say, coughs in their proximity\u2014\u201cWe\u2019re not by any way saying there is aerosolized transmission of the virus,\u201d coauthor Neeltje van Doremalen of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases tells the Associated Press.\n\nThe authors applied SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, the virus that caused the SARS outbreak of 2003, to plastic, stainless steel, copper, and cardboard in the lab and created aerosolized viruses using a nebulizer.\n\nThey found viable SARS-CoV-2 three hours after the virus was aerosolized and suspended in the air within a drum, and on surfaces four hours, 24 hours, and 2\u20133 days after it was deposited to copper, cardboard, and steel or plastic, respectively. SARS-CoV lasted about as long, although it lost viability sooner on cardboard and more slowly on copper. The median half-life for SARS-CoV-2 was 13 hours on steel and 16 hours on plastic.\n\nSee \u201cHow COVID-19 Is Spread"

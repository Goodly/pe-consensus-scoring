A mind-boggling report circulating in the Kremlin today prepared by the Ministry of Defense (MoD) states that the sudden launching yesterday by Aerospace Forces (AF) of two satellites are for the protection of the Federation naval research vessel Admiral Vladimisky—which has just departed the Saudi Arabian Port of Jeddah after taking on board a mysterious object described as the “Ark of Gabriel” whose importance is deemed so vital that President Putin has further ordered naval warships guided missile cruiser Varyag, the Sovremennyy-class destroyer Bystry, Boris Chilikin-class fleet oiler Boris Butoma, and the powerful salvage tug Alatau that upon the ending of their current mission in India, they are to rendezvous with the Admiral Vladimisky in the Southern Ocean providing it protection as it sails to Antarctica.

According to this report, the unprecedented mission being undertaken by the Admiral Vladimisky research vessel began on 6 November when it departed from Kronstadt on the Federation’s first Antarctica expedition in 30 years—and described by the MoD as having such “critical military-religious” significance its cargo includes capsules with Russian soil which will be placed in the areas of military glory and burial sites of Russian sailors at selected ports of call.

To what spurred this astonishing mission, this report explains, was the contacting on 25 September of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow by representatives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, regarding a mysterious ancient “device/weapon” discovered under the Masjid al-Haram Mosque (Grand Mosque) during what has turned into a very controversial construction project begun in 2014.

Gravely raising the concerns of the Grand Mosque emissaries, this report continues, was when this mysterious “device/weapon” was discovered on 12 September by a 15-man tunnel digging crew—and who in their attempting to remove it were instantly killed by a massive “plasma emission” so powerful it ejected from the ground toppling a construction crane killing, at least, another 107 people.

Catastrophically worse, this report notes, was that barely a fortnight after the first attempt to remove this mysterious “device/weapon” was made on 12 September, another attempt was made on 24 September which killed over 4,000 due to another massive “plasma emission” which put tens-of-thousands in panic—but which Saudi officials then blamed on a stampede.

After the catastrophic death toll involved with the Saudi’s second attempt to remove this mysterious “device/weapon”, this report says, His Holiness Patriarch Kirill was then contacted by the Grand Mosque emissaries in regards to one of the oldest Islamic manuscripts possessed by the Russian Orthodox Church that was saved from the Roman Catholic Crusaders in 1204 when they sacked the Church of Holy Wisdom (now known as Hagia Sophia) in Constantinople (present day Istanbul, Turkey) titled “Gabriel’s Instructions To Muhammad”.

Important to note, this report explains, and virtually unknown in the West, were that the Roman Catholic Crusades (and like they mirror today) were not only against the peoples of Islamic faith, but also against those having Russian Orthodox faith too—and why, during these crusades, the Russian Orthodox Church not only protected their own religious libraries from being destroyed, but also those belonging to Muslims.

As to the contents of this ancient Islamic manuscript, “Gabriel’s Instructions To Muhammad”, this report briefly notes, it centers around a group of instructions given to Muhammad by the Angel Gabriel in a cave called Hira, located on the mountain called Jabal an-Nour, near Mecca, wherein this heavenly being entrusted into Muhammad’s care a “box/ark” of “immense power” he was forbidden to use as it belonged to God only and was, instead, to be buried in a shrine at the “place of worship the Angels used before the creation of man” until its future uncovering in the days of Yawm al-Qīyāmah, or Qiyâmah, which means literally “Day of the Resurrection”.

Though this MoD report mentions virtually nothing about the conversations held between His Holiness Patriarch Kirill and the emissaries of the Grand Mosque in regards to this mysterious “weapon/device”, it does stunningly acknowledge that when President Putin was first informed about this grave situation, on 27 September, he not only immediately ordered the mission to Antarctica for the Admiral Vladimisky research vessel, he, also, further ordered 3 days later, on 30 September, Aerospace Forces to begin bombing Islamic State terrorists and targets in Syria.

As to what this mysterious “weapon/device” actually is we are not allowed to report on due to the strictures we have to abide by in being allowed to publish even the merest glimpses of what happens behind Kremlin walls we are currently permitted to do.

This also pertains to why Russia is helping Saudi Arabia move it to Antarctica—but with both of these nations soon to be at war with the fascist governments of the West, one need only watch the following video [or click HERE] of some of Russia’s top military officers explaining what they know of Antarctica, and its past, to figure out for oneself how critical, indeed, these times really are that we are living in.

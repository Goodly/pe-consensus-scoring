Title: Assassins Who Killed British MP Jo Cox And Targeted Donald Trump Tied To UK Military, CIA

A new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report circulating in the Kremlin today is raising serious questions relating to last weeks assassination of British Member of Parliament Jo Cox and the attempted assassination of Donald Trump as both the hit men involved in these plots have been traced to the same British Military mental hospital.

According to this report, on 16 June, British Labor Party MP Jo Cox was assassinated by Thomas Mair in Birstall, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, and a little more than 48 hours later, on 18 June, Michael Sandford attempted to assassinate US presidential candidate Donald Trump in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA.

Important to note about the political environment both of these assassination plots were operating within, this report continues, was that in MP Cox’s death the debate ahead of this weeks Brexit vote in the UK was able to be stalled, while in the US, the candidacy of Donald Trump for president has sent chills through the entire American elite governing system.

The SVR’s interest in both Mair and Sandford, this report explains, was elevated last year to a high level due to their interaction with a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) clandestine services operative named Lawrence Sanchez whose Federation surveillance records showed him taking a US Air Force flight from McGuire Field at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey, to RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom in April, 2015.

Though US public records state CIA operative Sanchez retried from this spy agency in 2004, this report notes, SVR records show him continuing to work for the CIA as late as 2012 when he was dismissed from his oversight of spying operations for the New York City Police Department where he had set up the United States most successful counter intelligence units combating Islamic inspired terrorism.

From 2012 to the present, this report continues, CIA operative Sanchez has worked within the 87th Medical Group at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst on projects involving various US Air Force bioenvironmental engineering projects—and when he traveled to Britain in early 2015, it was in that capacity SVR analysts were believing he did so.

However, this report explains, once arriving in Britain, CIA operative Sanchez traveled to Lincolnshire, England, accompanied by Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) operatives, where he entered a hospital facility known as the Lincolnshire Partnership.

The Lincolnshire Partnership hospital, this report states, has long been known to the SVR as it is the British militaries and intelligence services main facility for treating severely mentally impaired soldiers and spies, and operates under the supervision of the Defence Medical Services (DMS).

And in a patient record count during the time of CIA operative Sanchez’s April 2015 visit there, this report says, both Thomas Mair and Michael Sandford were listed as “high security” patients—but, and most strangely, Sandford was released into the custody of CIA operative Sanchez and was flown back to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and put under the medical supervision of the 87th Medical Group.

As neither Thomas Mair or Michael Sandford were previously known to the SVR, this report continues, their names were “electronically associated” with CIA operative Sanchez—and whose SVR computer file noted an alert on 16 June when Thomas Mair assassinated MP Jo Cox.

Once this 16 June alert on CIA operative Sanchez was analyzed by the SVR, this report says, an already established protocol was enacted to notify various British and American intelligence agencies requesting “guidance and assistance”—and that SVR analysts in this report credit with saving the life of Donald Trump.

In the SVR making this bold assertion that their actions had saved the life of Donald Trump, this report explains, was due to the United States Secret Service (USSS), on 17 June, changing their protection of Donald Trump to “snap-snap-snap” wherein just prior to his making any public appearance, both local police forces and government agents protecting his life are suddenly, and without notice, completely changed with entirely different personal.

US news reports about Donald Trump’s attempted assassination by Michael Sandford, also, support this SVR assertion by noting that his assassin had planned to use a gun to kill Trump from a local police guard he believed would have his weapon unsecured and that we would be able to quickly grab, fire at least two shots at Trump, and in return be killed by Secret Service agents.

Other US news reports contained in this SVR report note that the assassin of MP Jo Cox, Thomas Mair, was a “loner who needed treatment for mental illness”, and that Trump’s would be assassin, Michael Sandford, had been diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome (a form of autism) and in past attempted suicide.

This report concludes by noting that Trump’s would be assassin, Michael Sandford, appears to have been more highly trained than Thomas Mair as his unlimited source of funds to remain undetected in the US for so long, plus his availability to vehicles, airline travel, and expensive, and extended, hotel stays, show all of the tradecraft CIA master spy Sanchez has taught other operatives under his control, almost all of whom are known to the SVR—and whose CIA tactics to control them are well know too.
